This repository contains the trained models and model code for the autoencoder models described in our paper [under review].

A short jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the [generative half of the model](generative_decoder_demo.ipynb). The model requires tensorflow to be installed on your system, please refer to the [Tensorflow install instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) for detailed instructions for your OS and GPU.
